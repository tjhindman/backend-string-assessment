# Kenzie Academy: Strings Assignment
For this assessment, you'll be completing some string manipulation functions within the string1.py and string2.py files.

There is some light dependency on knowing how
[Functions](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)
work in python in terms of argument passing and return values, but you should
be able to figure it out as you go.

[string1.py](./string1.py) -- Complete the string functions in string1.py,
based on your knowledge of Python strings, indexing, slicing, and methods.

[string2.py](./string2.py) -- Additional string function completions.

# Workflow for this Assignment
1. *Fork* this repository into your own personal github account.
2. Then *Clone* your own repo to your local development machine.
3. Complete the missing parts of the string1.py and string2.py files to achieve desired functionality.
4. Commit your changes (with _meaningful_ commit messages e.g. not 'blah' or 'asdf' or 'updated code'), then `git push` back to your own github account.
5. From your personal Github repo, create a pull request (PR).  Add your instructor (and any other optional reviewers such as TAs and Coaches) to your PR.
6. Copy/Paste the URL link to your PR as your assignment submission.

# Extra Points:
Feel free to edit the README.md (this very text itself) of this assignment and break it.  The README is the front-most facing page of your work, so it should make a good impression.  As assigments get more complex, you will be expected to create READMEs with sufficient detail to capture all aspects of how your code is intended to be used: Cloning, dependencies, gotchas, quick-starts, deployment notes, etc.
