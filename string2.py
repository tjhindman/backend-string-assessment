String 2 questions for backend string assessment.

This is the second set of questions dealing with string manipulation.
This assessment is for us to practice on our ability
to work with strings.

# Additional basic string exercises

# D. verbing
# Given a string, if its length is at least 3,
# add 'ing' to its end.
# Unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case
# add 'ly' instead.
# If the string length is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
# Return the resulting string.


def verbing(s):
    """Your code goes here.  Edit this docstring."""

    if len(s) >= 3:
        if s[-3:] != "ing":
            return s + "ing"
        else:
            return s + "ly"
    else:
        return s

# E. not_bad
# Given a string, find the first appearance of the
# substring 'not' and 'bad'. If the 'bad' follows
# the 'not', replace the whole 'not'...'bad' substring
# with 'good'.
# Return the resulting string.
# So 'This dinner is not that bad!' yields:
# This dinner is good!
def not_bad(s):
    """Your code goes here.  Edit this docstring."""

    # s_list = s.split(" ")
    # s_check = ""

    # for i, c in enumerate(s_list):
    #     if c == "not":
    #         for c in s_list[i:]:
    #             if "bad" in c:
    #                 s_list[i:] == "good"

    # return s_list


# F. front_back
# Consider dividing a string into two halves.
# If the length is even, the front and back halves are the same length.
# If the length is odd, we'll say that the extra char goes in the front half.
# e.g. 'abcde', the front half is 'abc', the back half 'de'.
# Given 2 strings, a and b, return a string of the form
#  a-front + b-front + a-back + b-back
